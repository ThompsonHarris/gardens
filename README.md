## Running the project
First clone this repo and run `npm i`.

Secondly, create a database called 'garden' by running `createdb garden`.

Then in order to run your first build and kick off the server, use `npm run dev`, and the server will start on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000).

Webpack will watch the files. You should only need to refresh your browser. 

Run `node seed.js` to populate the DB with mock data
